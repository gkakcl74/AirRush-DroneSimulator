## Project Description
This game is designed based on realistic drone movements. Players use a drone controller to explore four maps of varying difficulty, collecting coins to earn points. A challenge element is added where points are deducted upon collision with objects. Ultimately, players receive up to three stars based on their score, encouraging improvement in control skills and providing a sense of achievement.
